Your README should say (paraphrased):

I built a minimal relational database engine from scratch in Java, including table storage, indexing, constraints, joins, and a SQL-like REPL.

To demonstrate real-world usage, I built a small jackpot system with an auditable ledger, inspired by financial systems, using my RDBMS as the only data store.

This hits all evaluation criteria.
